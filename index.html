		<p class="Projects-Description"> In high school, Maribel noticed a lack of opportunity for more advanced education opportunities in her community. As a high achieving student, herself, she found ways to go above and beyond by taking additional college classes, internships, etc. However, she still wanted others to have more readily available opportunities. So she conducted over 20 interviews to obtain a better understanding of what AP/Honors teachers have to complete in order to ensure the success of their classes, students that have been exposed to more advanced opportunities to hear about the challenges and benefits of taking more advanced courses were, and student advocates to learn about the best ways to help support students that are looking for more opportunities. She took over three school wide surveys to see if there was student demand for AP classes. She wrote and presented a proposal for the introduction of three new AP classes at the school the following year. They were all aproved. She now continuously returns to campus to provide feedback, check up on the progress of the classes and encourage highly motiviated students to pursue a degree at competitive universities and seek out life changing opportunities.

		As Vice President of Hermanos de Stanford, a latinx service group at Stanford University, Maribel attempted to change the culture of the group that was very heirarical to be more inclusive to new members. She established a new program called Hermanitos that would allow incoming members to get to meet older members, engage in fun activities, and participate in community service. There were over 30 matches made between new and old members and they continue to interact with each other and provide support throughout their four years in college.
